If using Hilbert Curve to sort colors you need the hilbert.py found on this page:

Houzz is a website that serves as a platform for home remodeling.
It is a technology company at heart and through the use of intelligent
data it hosts a community of more than 40 million homeowners home design
enthusiasts and home improvement professional across the country and
around the world. It brings together homeowners and home professionals
in a unique way.

In this repo I include code to sample of photographs found on the
Houzz website to learn what are the most common colors among different rooms
types commonly found in a Houzz home (bathroom, kitchen, etc). There is also a
classification machine learning model which uses pixel color
data to classify photographs into different room types (it is very poor given
just the pixel colors).
